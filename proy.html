<h1>Causes For Revolt</h1>
<p>The colonists' were apposed to having taxes imposed on them without
anyone to represent them in Parliament. They became even angrier by
four specific acts of law passed in 1774, particularly the Quartering
Act, which allowed British soldiers to take up lodgin
g in citizen's homes without permission. This led to the people writing
a Declaration of Independence to set forth the guidlines for the new
country they wished to establish.
While everyone knows that the Declaration of Independence was signed on
July 4, 1776, not everyone may realize that there were individual
declarations before that. Starting in 1775, each state declared itself
independent before they all came together as one to signal their
removal from British rule.</p>
<div class="divider">
<h1>War</h1>
<p>However, it is one thing to declare oneself independent, and another
to be able to make it so. This was not a "Bloodless Revolution." The
Patriots took on a long and hard fight to be free of British
occupation. After kicking the British out of Boston in 1775, the
Americans controlled all the colonies. However, the British came back
to New York and defeated the Colonial forces led by George Washington.
They held this ground until the end of the war. New York remained under
British control. However, an army marching from Canada under General
John Burgoyne met superior forces, and he surrendered at Saratoga in
1777. After the Americans proved they could win, they were aided by the
French who saw an opportunity to strike at their old foe, Great
Britain. Washington's troops also received training from Prussian
general Baron Friedrich von Steuben. When the British army in the South
led by General Cornwallis became trapped in Yorktown, Virginia, with
his back to the sea and troops led by Washington and Nathaniel Greene
in front of him, he surrendered. That unofficially e
nded the war. The British had had enough. Even though they still
maintained a strong force in New York, they agreed to let the colonies
free in 1783 in the Peace Treaty of Paris.</p>

<h1>The End</h1>
<p>The United States became an independent country with a government
comprised of a system of checks and balances. The governing bodies are
divided among the President, Congress and the House of Representatives.</p>
